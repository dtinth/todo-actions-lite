## Usage

The intended usage for this action is for you to totally own the code, giving you full control to change the actionâ€™s behavior to suit your needs.
No need for a configuration file when you can just edit the code.

Copy the directory `.github/actions/todo` and `.github/workflows/todo.yml` into your repository. You can run this command to do it:

```sh
curl -L https://github.com/dtinth/todo-actions-lite/tarball/main \
  | bsdtar xvzf - --strip-components=1 --include='*/.github/actions/todo' --include='*/.github/workflows/todo.yml'
```

**Note:** The default workflow runs the action on branch `main`. If your default branch is not `main`, make sure to change it accordingly.
